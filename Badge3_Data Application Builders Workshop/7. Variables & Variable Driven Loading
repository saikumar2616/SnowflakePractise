-- ðŸ““  Where Did the $$$'s Go?
-- We only need the dollar sign symbol when referring to a local variable. We don't use them when variables are used in a function, unless, you're using local variables and sending them to the function. Compare the code below to the code from the previous lab, above and make sure you understand the difference.

--ðŸ““  Snowflake Functions versus User-Defined Functions
-- Your Snowflake account comes with hundreds of functions already defined. When you define your own functions, you can use the system functions as part of the logic for your user-defined functions!
