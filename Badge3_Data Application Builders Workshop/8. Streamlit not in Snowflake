-- ðŸ““ An Indispensible Tool for Builders - The GitHub Account!
-- ðŸ§°  Create a GitHub Account (Optional)

-- ðŸ¥‹ Create a New Repo in Your GitHub Account (Required)
-- ðŸ¥‹ Download the Python File from Your SiS App
-- ðŸ¥‹ Create a streamlit_app.py File in Your Repo
-- ðŸŽ¯ Make a Second File for your Repo
    -- The other file that makes up your SiS app is called environment.yaml. Download that file. 
    
    -- Create a second file in your Repo called requirements.txt. Copy the contents of the environment.yaml file into the requirements.txt file and save the    file in your repo.     

-- ðŸ““ Changes Needed When Moving from SiS to SniS
    -- The biggest differences between SiS and SniS are: 
        
        -- 1) How users connect to your app.  
        -- 2) How you connect your app to Snowflake. 
        
    -- With SniS, users will be able to connect to your app more easily. You can set up your SniS app in a way that doesn't require them to log in or have a USER in your Snowflake account. In fact, Streamlit will host your app for free if you make it open to the public. 


        -- Remove below lines :
        --     from snowflake.snowpark.context import get_active_session
        --     session = get_active_session()


        -- And add below 2 lines:
        --     cnx = st.connection("snowflake")
        --     session = cnx.session()


-- ðŸ¥‹ Make Updates to the streamlit_app.py File

    -- Connecting your app to Snowflake is less easy in SniS than it was in SiS. In SiS, the connection happened automatically. In Streamlit, we'll need to carry out a number of steps. 
    
    -- We'll begin by making a few changes to the streamlit_app.py file in your GitHub Repo. 


-- ðŸŽ¯ Edit the requirements.txt File
