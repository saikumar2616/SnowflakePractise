    -- Your local Streamlit app will read secrets from a file .streamlit/secrets.toml in your appâ€™s root directory. Learn more about Streamlit secrets management here. Create this file if it doesnâ€™t exist yet and add your Snowflake username, password, account identifier, and the name of your warehouse, database, and schema as shown below:
        --     # .streamlit/secrets.toml
        
        -- [connections.snowflake]
        -- account = "xxx"
        -- user = "xxx"
        -- password = "xxx"
        -- role = "xxx"
        -- warehouse = "xxx"
        -- database = "xxx"
        -- schema = "xxx"
