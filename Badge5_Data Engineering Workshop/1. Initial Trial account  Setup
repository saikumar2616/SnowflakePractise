-- Kishore's USERNAME in his Snowflake Account is KISHOREK (it's what he uses to login to Snowflake).

-- He runs the following commands:

alter user saikumar2616 set default_role = 'SYSADMIN';
alter user saikumar2616 set default_warehouse = 'COMPUTE_WH';
alter user saikumar2616 set default_namespace = 'UTIL_DB.PUBLIC';



-- Data Engineers will use a role like SYSADMIN for most of their tasks. SYSADMIN is a creative role and Data Engineers are creative creators.
-- Throughout this workshop, you should use SYSADMIN for any task that doesn't require ACCOUNTADMIN. 

-- SYSADMIN should own any object you create. So databases, schemas, views, file formats, stages -- everything -- they should all be owned by the SYSADMIN role. 
-- Data Engineers in most companies don't even have the ACCOUNTADMIN role. You may use this role a time or two, but not often. When in doubt, SYSADMIN is the role to choose! 

-- Remember, you can set your default role to SYSADMIN, which is convenient for new worksheets and each time you login.

-- Use a command like this: 

-- ALTER USER <my user name> SET DEFAULT_ROLE = 'SYSADMIN';
