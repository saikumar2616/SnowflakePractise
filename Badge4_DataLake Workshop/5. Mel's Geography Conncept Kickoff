    -- Remember that latitude is counted from the Equator to the North Pole and then from the Equator to the South Pole. So latitude for any location in the world is always between 0 and 90 degrees.
    -- In some notation systems an N or S is used to indicate which side of the Equator a location falls on.
    -- In other systems, the Southern hemisphere is represented with negative numbers and the Northern hemisphere is represented with positive numbers. 


    -- Longitude is counted from the Greenwich Meridian Line (also called the Prime Meridian).
    
    -- So longitude is always between 0 and 180 degrees. If you start in Greenwich, England, UK, at zero degrees longitude, and head East, you will count up from zero to 180, until you get to Fiji on the other side of the globe. (Assuming you also drift South as you go.) If you head West from Greenwich, you will also count from zero to 180.
    
    -- In some notation systems an E or W is used with the number to indicate whether you are East or West of Greenwich. 
    
    -- In other systems, the Eastern hemisphere is represented with positive numbers and the Western hemisphere is represented with negative numbers.
