-- üìì Rapid Prototyping with Non-Loaded Data was the Perfect Approach!

    -- Zena and Mel were so smart not to spend a lot of time prepping, cleansing, normalizing, and loading their data.
    
    -- After all, doing that would have slowed them down and, in the end, the time could have been wasted if their proposals were rejected.
    
    -- Mel's parents, Igor and Melanie, saw the prototypes created by Zena and Mel and were happy to approve them. 
    
    -- There are many great use cases for non-loaded data:
        -- Rapid prototyping and proof of concept development (like we saw with Zena and Mel's projects)
        -- Unstructured Data that cannot be stored in traditional tables (like Zena needed in order to access the clothing images)
        -- Data used for mining and exploration by Data Scientists in prototyping possible AI/ML Models
        -- Data that cannot be moved by a company because of a regulatory restrictions


-- üñºÔ∏è Melanie and Igor are Super Excited about the New Project!
