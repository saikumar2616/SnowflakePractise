-- ðŸ““ What Did I Do Wrong? 
-- Did you run the query and get unexpected results? Here are some potential mistakes:

-- You have a typo in the schema name, like "WEGGIES" instead of "VEGGIES"
-- You put the schemas in the wrong database, like UTIL_DB, instead of GARDEN_PLANTS
-- You don't have your role set so that you can see the objects, like you created them using ACCOUNTADMIN, but your worksheet is set to SYSADMIN. 
-- ðŸ““ How Can I Fix Things? 
-- Typo:     ALTER SCHEMA GARDEN_PLANTS.WEGGIES RENAME TO GARDEN_PLANTS.VEGGIES;

-- Wrong Place:   ALTER SCHEMA DEMO_DB.VEGGIES RENAME TO GARDEN_PLANTS.VEGGIES;

-- Cant Find:   Change the Role Setting on your worksheet or transfer the ownership of your object.
